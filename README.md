My dotfiles project.  
Seems to be the hot thing to do these days.  
I think I want this to copy the files out of the repo into place, rather than symlinking.  I think this gets interesting when you start having multiple branches (say work and home) install work changes your shell context to work, install home changes your shell context to home.  Maybe interesting, may be useless.  Who knows.

See issues for current worklist  (going to track everything with -bugs- I mean /issues/)
