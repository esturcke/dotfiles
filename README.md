My dotfiles project.  
Seems to be the hot thing to do these days.  
I think I want this to copy the files out of the repo into place, rather than symlinking.  I think this gets interesting when you start having multiple branches (say work and home) install work changes your shell context to work, install home changes your shell context to home.  Maybe interesting, may be useless.  Who knows.

What I plan on having this thing do
- [ ] Get prezto auto installing
- [ ] Backup existing files
- [ ] Framework to configure how things get installed
- [ ] Branch switcher (don't backup files that _we_ installed)


Current External Modules
 - [my fork of prezto].  sorin's execellent zsh environment. https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto
